Each time I start up a new farm in _Stardew Valley_ or return to my 100-hour save on PC, I feel like I’m going home. There’s a comfort in _Stardew Valley_ that I’ve rarely found in other games. The music that changes with each season perfectly fits the mellowness of the 16-bit countryside town, and all the activities that await offer both peace in my daily routines and excitement in the land’s mysteries. Whether you want to farm, fish, fight monsters, craft, mine, become everyone’s best friend, or do a little bit of everything, this farming adventure has plenty to offer.

As we said in our original review, _Stardew Valley_ “beautifully combines farm simulation with RPG elements to create an intriguing, absorbing rural world,” and it’s only gotten better with each massive free update. Multiplayer, new items, buildings, farm types, events, and relationships give _Stardew Valley_ an even better foundation and more of a reason to stick around past the coveted event in the third in-game year.
